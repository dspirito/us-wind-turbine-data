# USWTDB Turbine Viewer

This is a Flask web application that consumes the U.S. Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB) API to display wind turbine information by state.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd turbine-data
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Features

*   Select a state from a dropdown menu.
*   View a list of wind turbines in the selected state.
*   Displays turbine project name, state, model, capacity, rotor diameter, hub height, and operational year.

## API Reference

The application consumes the U.S. Wind Turbine Database API, documented at:
[https://energy.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/](https://energy.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/)

## Chat History

create an app that consumes this api and has a dropdown of state, returns a list of the turbines:

@https://energy.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/ 

I will create a web application using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Here's a plan:
Backend (Flask):
Create app.py for the Flask application.
Create requirements.txt with Flask dependency.
Implement a route to serve the index.html template.
Implement an API endpoint to fetch a list of states from the USWTDB API.
Implement an API endpoint to fetch turbines by selected state from the USWTDB API.
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
Create templates/index.html with a dropdown for states and a section to display turbine data.
Use JavaScript to fetch the list of states from the Flask backend and populate the dropdown.
Use JavaScript to fetch turbine data based on the selected state and display it on the page.
Let's start by creating the app.py file.
Create app.py for Flask backend.
Create templates/index.html for the frontend.
Now I'll create the index.html file inside a templates directory.
Create requirements.txt for Flask dependency.
Next, I'll create requirements.txt to specify the Flask dependency.
Implement Flask route to serve the HTML.
The Flask route to serve the HTML is already implemented in app.py. I'll mark that as complete. Now, I will implement the Flask API endpoint to get a list of states.
Implement Flask API endpoint to get a list of states from USWTDB API.
I will add a new route /api/states to app.py that fetches distinct states from the USWTDB API.
Implement Flask API endpoint to get turbines by state from USWTDB API.
Now, I will implement the Flask API endpoint to get turbines by state.
I have now completed all the planned steps. The frontend JavaScript to fetch states and populate the dropdown, as well as fetch and display turbines, has been implemented in templates/index.html.
To run this application:
Make sure you have Python and pip installed.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application: python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see the dropdown populated with states, and when you select a state, the list of turbines for that state will appear.
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further features!
I'm glad to help with any further issues you may encounter! If you have additional questions or tasks, feel free to ask.
i cant run pip

It sounds like you're having trouble running pip. This can happen for a few reasons.
First, try using pip3 instead of pip. On some systems, especially those with both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, pip might default to Python 2 (or not be configured), while pip3 explicitly targets Python 3.
Let's try installing the dependencies using pip3:
Great! It looks like pip3 install -r requirements.txt was successful.
There are a couple of warnings in the output:
"WARNING: The script normalizer is installed in '/Users/davidspirito/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH." and "WARNING: The script flask is installed in '/Users/davidspirito/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH." This means that the flask command (and normalizer) might not be directly executable from your terminal without specifying the full path. However, our app.py runs with python app.py, so this shouldn't be an issue for running the application.
"WARNING: You are using pip version 21.2.4; however, version 25.2 is available." This is just a suggestion to upgrade pip itself, and doesn't prevent your current application from running.
Now that the dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the Flask application.
To run this application:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (if you're not already there).
Run the Flask application: python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
Update requirements.txt to specify a compatible Werkzeug version.
It looks like there's an ImportError related to werkzeug.urls when trying to run app.py. This usually means there's a version incompatibility between Flask and Werkzeug. Flask 2.0.3, which is specified in your requirements.txt, is not compatible with the Werkzeug version that got installed.
I'll update the requirements.txt to specify a compatible version of Werkzeug for Flask 2.0.3. A known compatible version is Werkzeug<2.1.0.
Now that I've updated requirements.txt, you'll need to reinstall the dependencies to get the correct Werkzeug version. This will likely involve uninstalling the current Werkzeug and then installing the compatible one.
Let's try this sequence of commands:
Uninstall the current Werkzeug: pip3 uninstall Werkzeug -y
Install all dependencies from the updated requirements.txt: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Then try running the Flask app again: python3 app.py
Great! It looks like Werkzeug 3.1.3 was successfully uninstalled, and then Werkzeug 2.0.3 was installed, which should resolve the compatibility issue.
Now, you should be able to run the Flask application.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (if you're not already there).
Run the Flask application: python3 app.py (using python3 as pip3 worked previously)
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Please let me know if you encounter any further issues!
does the api contain any further data about turbines such as power generation data over time? per month? or timeframe?

The USWTDB API documentation states that the database provides "turbine attribute data" such as t_cap (rated capacity), t_hh (hub height), t_rd (rotor diameter), and p_year (year turbine became operational).
However, based on the provided API documentation, there is no mention of power generation data over time, per month, or any specific timeframe. The available data focuses on the physical attributes of the turbines and project information at a given point in time.
The key-value codes section details all available fields, and none of them indicate time-series power generation data. You can review the documentation at https://energy.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/ for a complete list of available fields.
init a git repo for this app, create an readme.md file and add the entire contents of this chat to the md file. 

Initialize a Git repository.
Okay, I will do that. First, I'll initialize a Git repository in the current directory.
Create README.md file.
Now I will create the README.md file and add the chat content to it.
I'm unable to directly access the full chat history to write it into a file. However, I can create a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the application, and you can manually copy and paste the chat history into it if you wish. Would that work for you?
ok

I have initialized the Git repository and created the README.md file with detailed setup and usage instructions for the application.
Please remember to manually paste the chat history into the "Chat History" section of the README.md file if you'd like it included.
You can now commit these changes to your Git repository:
Add the files: git add .
Commit the changes: git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up Flask app, templates, requirements, and README"
